#HW 4 Plotly
I have successfully finished all tasks, for task 4 Dash part, there are some
things I need to address.
Because the limitation of 100MB file size in GitHub, I can't push 'images' folder
to the GitHub.
If you need to run the task 4 successfully, you should put the 'images' folder under
the directory'data/cars/images'!!!
